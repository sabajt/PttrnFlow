@protocol TickResponder <NSObject>

responders should handle animation and pass back a kTickEvent
those events should be defined by a kTickEvent enum.  
the timing should be handled in PD?

// example implementation from an object that adopts TickResponder, such as a left facing arrow: 
- (kTickEvent)tick:(bpm)bpm
{
	// animate
	[self startAnimation:bpm];

	// return desired tick event for our ticker 
	// we could add logic to support multiple return types
	return kTickEventLeft
}
